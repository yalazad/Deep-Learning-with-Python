In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are\n","words! But how should you represent a word in a computer? You could\n","store its ascii character representation, but that only tells you what\n","the word *is*, it doesn't say much about what it *means* (you might be\n","able to derive its part of speech from its affixes, or properties from\n","its capitalization, but not much). Even more, in what sense could you\n","combine these representations? We often want dense outputs from our\n","neural networks, where the inputs are $|V|$ dimensional, where\n","$V$ is our vocabulary, but often the outputs are only a few\n","dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels, for\n","instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller\n","dimensional space?\n","\n","How about instead of ascii representations, we use a one-hot encoding?\n","That is, we represent the word $w$ by\n","\n","\\begin{align}\\overbrace{\\left[ 0, 0, \\dots, 1, \\dots, 0, 0 \\right]}^\\text{|V| elements}\\end{align}\n","\n","where the 1 is in a location unique to $w$. Any other word will\n","have a 1 in some other location, and a 0 everywhere else.\n","\n","There is an enormous drawback to this representation, besides just how\n","huge it is. It basically treats all words as independent entities with\n","no relation to each other. What we really want is some notion of\n","*similarity* between words. Why? Let's see an example.\n","\n","Suppose we are building a language model. Suppose we have seen the\n","sentences\n","\n","* The mathematician ran to the store.\n","* The physicist ran to the store.\n","* The mathematician solved the open problem.\n","\n","in our training data.

Somehow they\n","  have a semantic relation.\n","* We have seen mathematician in the same role  in this new unseen sentence\n","  as we are now seeing physicist.\n","\n","and then infer that physicist is actually a good fit in the new unseen\n","sentence? This is what we mean by a notion of similarity: we mean\n","*semantic similarity*, not simply having similar orthographic\n","representations. It is a technique to combat the sparsity of linguistic\n","data, by connecting the dots between what we have seen and what we\n","haven't. This example of course relies on a fundamental linguistic\n","assumption: that words appearing in similar contexts are related to each\n","other semantically.
